                    <p>wer. didn't start in a boardroom. It started with a frustration —
                        good clothes that actually fit right, feel right, and last more than
                        a season were either too expensive, too loud, or just plain boring.
                        We were tired of settling. So we stopped settling and started building.</p>
                    <p>The idea was simple from day one: strip everything back. No
                        oversized logos screaming for attention. No trends chased just to
                        stay relevant. Just clean silhouettes, quality fabric, and pieces
                        that feel like they were made for you — because in a way, they were.</p>
                    <p>Every hoodie, every tee, every pair of pants, every hat we drop
                        goes through the same question before it ever reaches you — would
                        we actually wear this? If the answer isn't immediately yes, it
                        doesn't make the cut. That's not a marketing line, that's just
                        how we work.</p>
                    <p>wer. is for the ones who don't need to explain their style.
                        The ones who move quietly and dress intentionally. We're not
                        for everyone — and that's exactly the point.</p>
